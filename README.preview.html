<h2>Document parser usring pango</h2>

<p>This utility was created to quickly display a formatted file. It was
embarrassing to wait 25 seconds till the browser starts, just to display
a welcome screen.</p>

<p>The pangview utility is fast, it displays a regular README file in less than a second.</p>

<p>The format of the file is friendly, like pango, rich text or html.
(but simpler) The parser was written in python, it is easy to extend.</p>

<p>A quick intro:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;i&gt; Italic&lt;/i&gt;     for italic text
 &lt;b&gt; Bold &lt;/b&gt;      for bold text
 &lt;r&gt; Red &lt;/r&gt;       for red text
 &lt;xl&gt;Large&lt;/xl&gt;     for large text
</code></pre>

<p>Line that starts with a double hash is a comment.</p>

<h2>Comment</h2>

<p>Text in <hid>hidden</hid> tags are hidden from display.</p>

<p>For a full description of the Syntax see the SYNTAX file.</p>

<p>Note that this text displays nicely both on terminals and on the pangview
utility,</p>
